# Snake-NOIR
Artifact of the ancient history.<br/>
One of my oldest significant C++ projects (2011).<br/>
A 3D snake game made on DirectX10 api.<br/>
Does not compile on current Visual Studio because DXSDK wad deprecated years ago.<br/>
Plays horribly. Looks disgusting. Code looks even worse. Isn't it cool?<br/>
